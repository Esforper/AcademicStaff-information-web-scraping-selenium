# AcademicStaff Information Web Scraping with Selenium

This Python script uses Selenium to scrape academic staff emails from a university website. It prompts the user for the website URL and the class name of the HTML element containing the academicians' emails. It then prints out the emails and counts the total number of academicians.

## Prerequisites

- Python installed
- Selenium library installed (`pip install selenium`)
- Microsoft Edge WebDriver installed and added to PATH

## Usage

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/AcademicStaff-information-web-scraping-selenium.git

    ```

2. Run the script:

    ```bash
    python AcademicStaff.py
    ```

    Follow the prompts to enter the URL and class name.

## Configuration
